## Luwa Hiking App Prototype

During my time as a student at NMIT, I worked part time at MacPac in Nelson. I met a lot of people that were into ultralight tramping and they were always looking for ways to reduce the weight of their gear. I decided to make a prototype of an app that would help them with this. The prototype is still a bit rough around the edges, but it works.

## Luwa's Future

I have been chipping away at an updated version of this app in my free time. Hopefully, in the near future I will have a more polished version to show here.
