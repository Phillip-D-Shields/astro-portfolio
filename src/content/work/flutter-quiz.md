description: |
  A quiz app about using Flutter. The app uses dummy data for the questions, but the code makes for great boilerplate for future projects that import data from external sources. The quiz app was a great intro into state management in Flutter and Dart, and there are lots of Dart features used in the code like ternary operators, if statements, for loops, and conditional rendering.
