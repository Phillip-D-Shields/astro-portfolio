  Lately, I have been exploring Flutter and Dart. I have always been a fan of material design and have been curious about using Flutter for a couple years. My current projects are simple and have helped me learn and practice the fundamentals of Flutter and Dart. I have a few more technical projects in the pipeline that will help reinforce the basics and introduce more complex aspects of Flutter and Dart.

## Project 00: Dice Rolling App

<img src="../../../public/assets/dice_roller.png" alt="dice rolling app" width="25%" />

Super simple app. Just press a button and get a random dice roll. Nothing fancy, just a nice casual intro to Flutter and Dart to learn the basics.

## Project 01: Quiz App

<img src="../../../public/assets/quiz.mov.gif" alt="quiz app" width="25%" />

A quiz app about using Flutter. The app uses dummy data for the questions, but the code makes for great boilerplate for future projects that import data from external sources. The quiz app was a great intro into state management in Flutter and Dart, and there are lots of Dart features used in the code like ternary operators, if statements, for loops, and conditional rendering.

## Project 02: Expense Tracking App

<img src="../../../public/assets/expenses_landscape.mov.gif" alt="expense tracking app landscape view" width="50%" />


This app was a big step up from the previous. There is more interactivity, a wider number of custom and standard widgets, some basic theming, and responsive design that allows the app to be viewed and used via portrait or landscape on mobile devices.
