## Language Learning App

> "Ko taku reo taku ohooho, ko taku reo taku mapihi mauria"

"My language is my awakening, my language is the window to my soul"

### The Original Plan

Some time ago, a good friend and I discussed the idea of creating a language learning app. My friend is a native speaker and tutor of Te Reo MƒÅori. We both have a passion for language and culture, and we wanted to create a tool that would help people, especially kids, learn languages in a fun and engaging way. 

### The Pending Plan

We are still discussing the idea. We have plenty of ideas and passion, but we are both lacking the free time to dedicate to the project. Sadly, the project is on the back burner for now. But the [landing page prototype](https://sprightly-sherbet-08bec4.netlify.app/) is still pretty nice.

#### The evolution of Digiwha

I really liked the name Digiwha, pronounced like "digi'fah". I decided to use it for my personal brand. I am a digital designer and developer starting to focus on contract work, so it seemed fitting to my ambitions.
