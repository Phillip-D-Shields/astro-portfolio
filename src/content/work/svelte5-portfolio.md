## Svelte 5 

This portfolio is built using Sveltekit, Svelte 5, and Sanity CMS. I have been a big fan of Svelte for the last few years. Svelte 5 introduced runes amongst a few other features that I was not yet familiar with, so I decided to work on a simple portfolio to use for learning and reference.
